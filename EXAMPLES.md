2. **Create separate configs**

`config_en.yaml`:
```yaml
ai:
  provider: openai_compatible
  model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
  # ... API settings
app:
  sitemap_url: "https://example.com/en/sitemap.xml"
  input_excel_path: "queries_en.xlsx"
  output_directory: "output/en"
```

`config_es.yaml`:
```yaml
ai:
  provider: openai_compatible
  model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
  # ... API settings
app:
  sitemap_url: "https://example.com/es/sitemap.xml"
  input_excel_path: "queries_es.xlsx"
  output_directory: "output/es"
```

3. **Run separately**
```bash
python main.py -c config_en.yaml
python main.py -c config_es.yaml
```

## ðŸ“Š Example 4: Local Business SEO

### Scenario
Local service business (e.g., plumber, lawyer) wanting to rank for local queries.

### Workflow

1. **Export geo-specific data**
   - Filter by country/region in Search Console
   - Focus on "near me" and location-based queries

2. **Configure for local SEO**
```yaml
app:
  sitemap_url: "https://localbusiness.com/sitemap.xml"
  min_position: 5  # Even position 6-10 matters for local
  max_headings_per_article: 6  # Shorter, local-focused content
```

3. **AI prompts will focus on**
   - Local intent keywords
   - Service area coverage
   - Local landing pages

## ðŸ“Š Example 5: Content Gap Analysis

### Scenario
Competitor analysis - find topics they rank for but you don't.

### Workflow

1. **Gather competitor queries** (manual or tools)
   - Create `competitor_queries.xlsx` with same format
   - Columns: Query, Clicks (set to 0), Impressions (estimated), CTR, Position (estimated)

2. **Run analysis**
```bash
python main.py -i competitor_queries.xlsx
```

3. **Focus on new_content_suggestions.xlsx**
   - These are topics you're missing
   - AI provides structure to create competitive content

done
```
